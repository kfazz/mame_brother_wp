Copyright: MAME team
License: CC0-1.0
 CC0 1.0 Universal
 .
 Statement of Purpose
 .
 The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
 exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator and
 subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work of
 authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").
 .
 Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for the
 purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and scientific
 works ("Commons") that the public can reliably and without fear of later
 claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works, reuse
 and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever and for any
 purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes. These owners may
 contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the
 further production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain
 reputation or greater distribution for their Work in part through the use and
 efforts of others.
 .
 For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation
 of additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a
 Work (the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright
 and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work
 and publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her
 Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal
 effect of CC0 on those rights.
 .
 1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be
 protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and
 Related Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited
 to, the following:
 .
   i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate,
   and translate a Work;
 .
   ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);
 .
   iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or likeness
   depicted in a Work;
 .
   iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,
   subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;
 .
   v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in
   a Work;
 .
   vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the
   European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal
   protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof,
   including any amended or successor version of such directive); and
 .
   vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world
   based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations thereof.
 .
 2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of,
 applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and
 unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer's Copyright
 and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now
 known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of
 action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum
 duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time
 extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of
 copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation
 commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the "Waiver"). Affirmer makes
 the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and to the
 detriment of Affirmer's heirs and successors, fully intending that such Waiver
 shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or
 any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work
 by the public as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.
 .
 3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be
 judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver
 shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account
 Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the Waiver
 is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a royalty-free,
 non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and
 unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights in
 the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration
 provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii)
 in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any
 purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or
 promotional purposes (the "License"). The License shall be deemed effective as
 of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the
 License for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under
 applicable law, such partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not
 invalidate the remainder of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby
 affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining
 Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims
 and causes of action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to
 Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.
 .
 4. Limitations and Disclaimers.
 .
   a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,
   surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.
 .
   b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties
   of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or otherwise,
   including without limitation warranties of title, merchantability, fitness
   for a particular purpose, non infringement, or the absence of latent or
   other defects, accuracy, or the present or absence of errors, whether or not
   discoverable, all to the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.
 .
   c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons
   that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without limitation
   any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work. Further, Affirmer
   disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary consents, permissions
   or other rights required for any use of the Work.
 .
   d. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a
   party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to this
   CC0 or use of the Work.

 conditions:
 (1) If any part of the source code for this software is distributed, then this
 README file must be included, with this copyright and no-warranty notice
 unaltered; and any additions, deletions, or changes to the original files
 must be clearly indicated in accompanying documentation.
 (2) If only executable code is distributed, then the accompanying

 the Independent JPEG Group".
 (3) Permission for use of this software is granted only if the user accepts
 full responsibility for any undesirable consequences; the authors accept
 NO LIABILITY for damages of any kind.

 These conditions apply to any software derived from or based on the IJG code,
 not just to the unmodified library.  If you use our work, you ought to

 Permission is NOT granted for the use of any IJG author's name or company name

 ansi2knr.c is included in this distribution by permission of L. Peter Deutsch,
 sole proprietor of its copyright holder, Aladdin Enterprises of Menlo Park, CA.
 ansi2knr.c is NOT covered by the above copyright and conditions, but instead
 by the usual distribution terms of the Free Software Foundation; principally,
 that you must include source code if you redistribute it.  (See the file
 ansi2knr.c for full details.)  However, since ansi2knr.c is not needed as part
 of any program generated from the IJG code, this does not limit you more than
 the foregoing paragraphs do.
 .
 The Unix configuration script "configure" was produced with GNU Autoconf.
 It is copyright by the Free Software Foundation but is freely distributable.
 The same holds for its supporting scripts (config.guess, config.sub,
 ltmain.sh).  Another support script, install-sh, is copyright by X Consortium
 but is also freely distributable.
 .
 The IJG distribution formerly included code to read and write GIF files.
 To avoid entanglement with the Unisys LZW patent, GIF reading support has
 been removed altogether, and the GIF writer has been simplified to produce
 "uncompressed GIFs".  This technique does not use the LZW algorithm; the
 resulting GIF files are larger than usual, but are readable by all standard
 GIF decoders.

 We are required to state that

 This code implements the MD5 message-digest algorithm.
 The algorithm is due to Ron Rivest.  This code was
 written by Colin Plumb in 1993, no copyright is claimed.
 This code is in the public domain; do with it what you wish.
 .
 Equivalent code is available from RSA Data Security, Inc.
 This code has been tested against that, and is equivalent,
 except that you don't need to include two pages of legalese
 with every copy.
 .
 To compute the message digest of a chunk of bytes, declare an
 MD5Context structure, pass it to MD5Init, call MD5Update as
 needed on buffers full of bytes, and then call MD5Final, which
 will fill a supplied 16-byte array with the digest.
 . 
 Changed so as no longer to depend on Colin Plumb's `usual.h' header
 definitions; now uses stuff from dpkg's config.h.
 - Ian Jackson <ijackson@nyx.cs.du.edu>.
 Still in the public domain.
