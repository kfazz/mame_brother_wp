Description: Multiple Arcade Machine Emulator (MAME)
 MAME is an emulator: it reproduces, more or less faithfully, the behavior of
 several arcade machines. But hardware is useless without software, so an image
 of the ROM which run on that hardware is required. Such ROM, like any other
 commercial software, are copyrighted material and it is therefore illegal to
 use them if you don't own the original arcade machine. Needless to say, ROM
 are not distributed together with MAME. Distribution of MAME together with ROM
 images is a violation of copyright law and should be promptly reported to the
 authors so that appropriate legal action can be taken.
 .
 This package provides a specific binary and configuration file for the SDL
 (Simple Direct Media Layer) version of MAME (Multiple Arcade Machine Emulator)
 but without games (ROMs). Remember that you NEED the ROM images to play a game
 because SDLMAME is not a game emulator, just an arcade machine one.
