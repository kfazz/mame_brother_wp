MAME for Debian
------------------

MAME(TM) means Multiple Arcade Machine Emulator.

This package only installs the material binary emulator, not the arcade dumps
known as ROMs or Romsets: MAME is not a game itself and you will have to obtain
dumps from arcade boards you own.


@todo : explain how package installs MAME on the system, how to start, default
configuration and how to change it.
