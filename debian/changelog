  [ Jordi Mallach ]
  * New upstream release.
    - Includes Steven Chamberlain's kfreebsd fixes for several build errors
      on kfreebsd-*. Many thanks! (closes: #830974)
    - Includes fixes for ppc64el builds (closes: #825483).
  * Install bgfx, language, plugins and uismall.bdf files in mame-data.
    Thanks to Vas Crabb for pointing this out.
  * Add a override_dh_auto_test that just runs "mame -valid" after the build.
    For now, make it non-fatal.
  * Add some additional docs to the mame binary.
  * Use system libuv.
  * Install default plugin.ini and ui.ini files as examples.
  * Add an empty override_dh_auto_build-indep rule, so arch-independent
    don't actually build the whole thing. Also rename dh_auto_test to
    their -arch variants.
  * Add libutil-freebsd-dev to Build-Depends for kfreebsd-any.
  * Add hurd.patch with some fixes to the build on hurd-i386 systems.
  * Add a makefile hack to allow building on a "gnu" platform with genie.
  * Drop remove-m64_flag_for_mips64el_alpha.patch, merged upstream.
  * Make mame build verbosely by default, without entangling it to DH_VERBOSE.
  * Remove generated doxygen docs for a 3rdparty module from source (lintian).
  * Prune more generated binaries from the source tarball (lintian).
  * Remove unused lintian overrides.

  [ Cesare Falco ]
  * Improved get-orig-source target
  * Updated mame.ini files to most recent *path entries

    libportmidi-dev is not available on these.
  * Add -ldl to LDFLAGS on kFreeBSD to fix an early build failure.
  * Make GENIEOS=freebsd so the actual genie binary is called.

    (closes: #507932). 
  * Setup the source dir to enable building mess even if its source is in
    a mess subdir, by creating necessary symlinks and directory renames
    before the build, and restoring everything on clean.
  * Rework debian/rules as needed to make mess fit in.
  * Create a minimal mess.ini (identical to mame.ini).
  * Add castool and imgtool to mame-tools.
  * Improve desktop file and translate it to Catalan.

  [ Cesare Falco ]
  * Initial merge from Ubuntu package.
  * Some imports from corresponding debian/ files from Ubuntu package:
    - control: sdlmame/sdlmame-tools transitional packages
      (upgrading from Ubuntu 10.04 LTS still needs them)
    - rules:
      + override dh_installchangelogs instead of dh_auto_install
      + override_dh_install, exclude keymaps for OSX
      + renamed clean to override_dh_auto_clean, moved up
      + strip CR from source files
    - watch: added URL for MESS
    - mame-tools: removed unidasm, tool intended for development only
    - manpages for mess, castool and imgtool

  [ Emmanuel Kasper ]
  * Remove executable bit set by windows on all mess hash files 
  * Fix clean rule on a clean tree.
  * Add copyright information for MESS sources.
  * Remove symlinking of megatech.xml.
  * Add README.Debian for the mess binary package.
  * Create a mess-data package for mess architecture independent files

mame (0.141-3) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Emmanuel Kasper ]
  * Add make variables to build on GNU/kFreeBSD

  [ Jordi Mallach ]
  * Add fix_powerpc_build.patch: Fix an incorrectly declared ifdef that
    made big-endian builds fail.
  * Set NOASM=1 globally, and unset for the targets that are known to have
    a native ASM implementation (x86 and ppc). Builds for most other
    Debian architectures will fail due to memory alignment issues, though.
  * Add a minimal mame.ini, only showing the default paths options and
    other important options like "video" or "multithreading", and install
    it as a proper conffile.
  * Remove mame.postinst and mame.prerm, to stop generating a mame.ini
    file on postinst, which was never being updated on upgrades.
  * If the generated mame.ini in 0.141-1 or 0.141-2 is not modified,
    remove mame.ini to avoid a dpkg conffile prompt.
  * Autogenerate a mame.ini using mame -createconfig after the build is
    done, and install it as an example.
  * Change all uses of Conflicts to Breaks.
  * Bump debhelper compat version to 8.
  * Bump Standards-Version to 3.9.2 (no changes needed).
  * Use bzip2 for the debian tar.
  * Upload to unstable.

  * Built from sdlmame 0.135 package and inspired from xmame 0.106 package.
