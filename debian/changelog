mame (0.141-3) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Emmanuel Kasper ]
  * Add make variables to build on GNU/kFreeBSD

  [ Jordi Mallach ]
  * Add fix_powerpc_build.patch: Fix an incorrectly declared ifdef that
    made big-endian builds fail.
  * Set NOASM=1 globally, and unset for the targets that are known to have
    a native ASM implementation (x86 and ppc). Builds for most other
    Debian architectures will fail due to memory alignment issues, though.
  * Add a minimal mame.ini, only showing the default paths options and
    other important options like "video" or "multithreading", and install
    it as a proper conffile.
  * Remove mame.postinst and mame.prerm, to stop generating a mame.ini
    file on postinst, which was never being updated on upgrades.
  * If the generated mame.ini in 0.141-1 or 0.141-2 is not modified,
    remove mame.ini to avoid a dpkg conffile prompt.
  * Autogenerate a mame.ini using mame -createconfig after the build is
    done, and install it as an example.
  * Change all uses of Conflicts to Breaks.
  * Bump debhelper compat version to 8.
  * Bump Standards-Version to 3.9.2 (no changes needed).
  * Use bzip2 for the debian tar.
  * Upload to unstable.

  * New upstream release

 -- Emmanuel Kasper <emmanuel@libera.cc>  Thu, 25 Nov 2010 07:41:21 +0100

mame (0.139-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Built from sdlmame 0.135 package and inspired from xmame 0.106 package.
    Closes: #424905.
  * This package replaces sdlmame as "there are no longer separate programs
    called SDLMAME or SDLMESS. Instead, the SDL capability is included in MAME
    and MESS" - http://rbelmont.mameworld.info/?page_id=163
