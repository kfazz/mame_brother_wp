mame (0.139-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Built from sdlmame 0.135 package and inspired from xmame 0.106 package.
    Closes: #424905.
  * This package replaces sdlmame as "there are no longer separate programs
    called SDLMAME or SDLMESS. Instead, the SDL capability is included in MAME
    and MESS" - http://rbelmont.mameworld.info/?page_id=163
