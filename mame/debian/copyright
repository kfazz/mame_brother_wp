 SoftFloat was written by me, John R. Hauser.  This work was made possible in
 part by the International Computer Science Institute, located at Suite 600,
 1947 Center Street, Berkeley, California 94704.  Funding was partially
 provided by the National Science Foundation under grant MIP-9311980.  The
 original version of this code was written as part of a project to build
 a fixed-point vector processor in collaboration with the University of
 California at Berkeley, overseen by Profs. Nelson Morgan and John Wawrzynek.

 has been made to avoid it, THIS SOFTWARE MAY CONTAIN FAULTS THAT WILL AT

 LOSSES, COSTS, OR OTHER PROBLEMS THEY INCUR DUE TO THE SOFTWARE, AND WHO
 FURTHERMORE EFFECTIVELY INDEMNIFY JOHN HAUSER AND THE INTERNATIONAL COMPUTER
 SCIENCE INSTITUTE (possibly via similar legal warning) AGAINST ALL LOSSES,

Files: src/lib/util/md5.*
Copyright: Public domain
Licence:
 This code implements the MD5 message-digest algorithm.
 The algorithm is due to Ron Rivest.  This code was
 written by Colin Plumb in 1993, no copyright is claimed.
 This code is in the public domain; do with it what you wish.
 .
 Equivalent code is available from RSA Data Security, Inc.
 This code has been tested against that, and is equivalent,
 except that you don't need to include two pages of legalese
 with every copy.
 .
 To compute the message digest of a chunk of bytes, declare an
 MD5Context structure, pass it to MD5Init, call MD5Update as
 needed on buffers full of bytes, and then call MD5Final, which
 will fill a supplied 16-byte array with the digest.
 . 
 Changed so as no longer to depend on Colin Plumb's `usual.h' header
 definitions; now uses stuff from dpkg's config.h.
 - Ian Jackson <ijackson@nyx.cs.du.edu>.
 Still in the public domain.
